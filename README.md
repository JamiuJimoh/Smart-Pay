# smart_pay

A technical 'take-home' from Apex Network.

### Features Added

- Onboarding screen
- Sign In & Sign Up auth flow
- HomePage
- Form validation
- Pin page resend button timer

### Problems Encountered

- The API was confusing at first because there was a discrepancy between it and the UI. According to the API, you need to verify your email with an OTP before you can register.
- The OTP is not sent to the mail provided, you can only get it from the response of the request.
- I could find a more efficient way for my implementation of the country picker but given the short time, I could not come up with one. The country picker is a little bit laggy, due to the fact that i'm displaying all countries at once.

# NB:-
I couldn't finish the whole task, due to the shortage of time. A task I couldn't finish is the one where you can close the app while still logged in and opening the app to get to the PIN page to unlock the home page.
